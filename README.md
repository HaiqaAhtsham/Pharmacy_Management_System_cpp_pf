# Pharmacy Management System
The Functional Pharmacy Management System is a robust and user-friendly software designed to streamline and optimize the operations of a pharmacy. This system employs functional programming principles to ensure efficiency and maintainability while encompassing essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, file handling, and exceptional handling mechanisms
## Key Features:
### Functional Design Pattern:
Embracing the functional design pattern, the system emphasizes immutability, higher-order functions, and pure functions. This design choice enhances code readability, maintainability, and reduces the likelihood of bugs, making the pharmacy management system more reliable.

### CRUD Operations:
The system supports all fundamental CRUD operations for managing pharmacy data. Users can seamlessly add new medicines, retrieve information about existing ones, update stock quantities, and remove outdated products. The functional paradigm ensures that these operations are executed with minimal side effects and in a deterministic manner.

### File Handling:
The system employs efficient file handling mechanisms to store and retrieve data persistently. Medication details, stock levels, and other relevant information are stored in files using functional approaches. This ensures data integrity and facilitates easy backups, imports, and exports.

### Exceptional Handling:
Robust exceptional handling is integrated into the system to deal with unexpected scenarios gracefully. Whether it's handling input errors, file read/write issues, or other unforeseen circumstances, the system employs functional techniques to manage exceptions, maintaining a smooth and error-resistant user experience.
